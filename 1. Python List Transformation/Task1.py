#Task 1: Given the list of grades:
#grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]
#Sort the grades in descending order and print the sorted list.

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]

grades.sort(reverse=True) #geekforgeeks taught me this. It's cleaner IMO
print(grades)

#can also run as follows:
#grades.sort()
#grades.reverse()
#print(grades)
